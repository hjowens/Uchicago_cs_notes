Put annotations regarding the datatypes of class variabales at the start of the class 
(seen in Juno notebook)

Composition relationship- when one object contains, is composed of, or is related to other objects.

- Ask: Does a class have a class? Is a class composed of other classes? Does it contain them?

Inheritance relationship- When a class inherits properties from a "parent" class.

The init method is what initializes the class. When you define the class in a new object,
the init method is what is called, taking in parameters and executing the enclosed code.

When modeling something with inheritance, you want to look at what is the most/more general type, 
allowing for one to be more easily enclosed within the other.

Declaring inheritance- Declare the class and then immediately next to the class name put the name
of the parent class in parenthesis (for python in JUNO).

When overwriting functions/methods in the parent class, you need to make sure they have the exact 
same names. Otherwise it will just be seen as a unique method.

There is a built in function called super() that allows you to access the methods of the
parent class.

Examine OO inheritance notebook for specifics. Make annotations for understanding.
