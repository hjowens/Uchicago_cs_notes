- Merge conflict- When the pull from the repository conflicts with local files. You will need to manually go through the files and resolve the changes.
- To avoid constant merge conflicts, you can create branches to work separately and merge the branches when someone is done with the work.
- Can create and merge branches from the git website. Use a pull request to merge branches together.
