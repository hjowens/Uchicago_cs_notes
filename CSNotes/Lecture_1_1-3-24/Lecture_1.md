Software developement encompasses skills different from just coding. It's a collaborative job. 
This class will focus both on coding skills and teamwork skills.

Install parties in CSOL 1 and 2 in the first floor of the Crerar library.

Lecture notes are published for every lecture 1-2 days after the class.

Not enough to produce code that "works." It needs to be well structured and well executed as well.
Thus we're going to spend a few lectures to cover these skills.


Three Main Skills:

- Deubugging: Runnning code until encountering error, then resolving them as they come.
- Static Checking: Checking the structure, logic, and datatypes of the code before running.
- Unit Testing: Designing your own tests to ensure that your code works as expected.

Two ways to do Static Checking: 

- Syntax Checking
- Type Checking

Take type checking seriously; it's saved hours and hours of debugging and frustration before.
