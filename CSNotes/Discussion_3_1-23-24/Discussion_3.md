Text-User Interfaces: Live-Coding Hangman

Similar to pygames, the game class is initialized and then the "game loop" is begun. Here the game loop is implemented based on player inputs, while in pygame (at least in our examples), the game loop is run with a while loop started at the end of the game class initializer.

See games.py class file for specifics of how the game class works.
